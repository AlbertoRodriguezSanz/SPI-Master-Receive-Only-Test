The SPI module for the slave device is implemented through 

### SPI Slave Device

This device's firmware is programmed through "bare metal coding", which is a low-level type of programming (C language), without any abstraction or superior software layers, that is hardcoded to the device at a hardware level and optimizes code execution. The same definition and implementation of the functions used in the master device are done for the slave device in the `main.c` file directly, removing two abstraction layers.

## Device configuration

- Configuration bits (CONFIG1-5H/L registers)
  - Oscillator source at power-up: High frequency internall oscillator with no clock division applied
  - Master Clear and Low Voltage Programming: MCLR and LVP are enabled, making the MCLR pin work for as a master clear for programming.
  - Brown-out Reset: Disabled, device will not reset when voltage drops under a certain threshold.
  - Watchdog Timer: Disabled, the Windowed Watchdog Timer will not be enabled for this test, to check for timing inaccuracies while executing instructions.
- Clock Manager (OSCCON1 and OSCFRQ registers)
  -   Clock Frequency: 16MHz, proceeding from a 64MHz base High-Frequency Oscillator Clock
- Pin Manager:
  -  LED pin -> RC2 (output)
  -  Slave Select -> RA5 (input)
  -  SPI clock -> RC3 (input)
  -  SPI Data Out (SDO) -> RC5 (output)
  -  SPI Data In (SDI) -> RC4 (input)

The message reception is done through the SPI1_ByteExchange function, even though the master is not meant to send any data out. This function already implements the process for reading the receive buffer when a byte is stored and the interrupt flag sets. As for the transmitted message from the master device, the user can send a 0x00 byte to avoid sending anything if the TXR bit was to be set.
